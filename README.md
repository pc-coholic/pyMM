Proof of Concept code for a Nortel Millennium Manager

The code in this repository serves purely as a documentation of my earliest attempts at creating a working Millennium Manager backend for Nortel Millennium payphones.

The code here does indeed work as a minimum viable provisioning for a Millennium Deskset - although it does still have some bugs.

The code in this repository will probably not be developed a lot further, since the Millennium Panel (https://github.com/pc-coholic/millennium-panel/) is aiming at providing a more comfortable way of configuration and Howard's mm_manager (https://github.com/hharte/mm_manager/) is already providing a working lowlevel backend.
